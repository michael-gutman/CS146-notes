### Reading Strings

```C
char name[20];
printf("What is your name");
scanf("%s", name);
```

- What if you type more than 19 letters?
- Scanf doesn't know how long name[] is
- buffer overflow

#### Never use scanf with %s
```C
scanf("%19s", name)
```
- Will note read more than 19 chars, safer.

Safer strcpy, strcat
- strncpy, strncat, strncmp

```C
strncpy(target, source, n)
```
- copies source into target until '\\0' is encountered or n chars have been copied
- If strncpy stops because n chars have been copied, ie source longer than n, it does not add a null terminator
  - have to add it yourself

#### Careful
```C
char msg[6] = "hello"; // h, e, l, l, o, \0
char msg[15] = "hello"; // h, e, l, l, o, \0, \0, ..., \0
char msg[5] = "hello"; // h, e, l, l, o
char msg[4] = "hello"; // h, e, l, l
```

### Adding Functions to SIMP
- Invent new syntax:

```
(fun (f x y)
  (vars [(i 10 j 10)]
    (set i (+ (* j x) y))
    (return (* i i))))
```

- Now, distinguished function main (no params) starts the program
- How do we compile this to PRIMP?
- Problem: function return - where do you go back?
- need to return to where you left off
- Need to save PC somewhere and restore it when time to return
- No current PRIMP instruction lets you save PC
  - need to cheat again

```
(jsr (50) 10) ; jump to subroutine
```
- M[50]<-PC, PC<-10
  - Note: fetch-execute: PC has already been incremented, so it saves the address of the next line
- function return: (jump (50)), PC<-M[50]

Arguments and Results
- Simple method: Dedicated location for every fn arg and result

```
(fun (f x y)
  (vars [] (return (+ x y))))
->
(label START_f)
(add RETURN-VALUE-f ARG-f-x ARG-f-y)
(jump RETURN-ADDRESS-f)
(data RETURN-ADDRESS-f 0)
(data RETURN-VALUE-f 0)
(data ARG-f-x 0)
(data ARG-f-y 0)
```
Function Call
```
(f exp1 exp2)
->
exp1-code
(move ARG-f-x TMP1)
exp2-code
(move ARG-f-y TMP2)
(jsr RETURN-ADDRESS-f START-f)
(move TMP3 RETURN-VALUE-f)
```
- This is the model followed by old FORTRAN and COBOL compilers
- Does not permit recursion
  - dedicated spaces would be overwritten

Recursion would be nice to have....
- each active function call (not just function) needs space to store arguments, locals, return address
- use a stack
- As temporaries (intermediate values) come and go (are pushed and popped), SP changes
- accessing args and locals by offset from SP (as we will do) becomes difficult, as offsets constantly change

Common Solution: Frame pointer
- points to the other end of the stack frame

| CODE     |
| :------------- |
| f frame        | <- FP
| g frame        |
| . . . .        | <- SP
- Offsets from FP will not change, even if SP moves
- previous value of FP must also be saved on stack
- To allocate a stack frame: add the amount of needed space to the stack pointer
- To deallocate - subtract this amount from the stack pointer (put the stack pointer at the frame pointer)
- So: Function calls incur overhead

#### Consider
```
(fun (fact-h n acc)
  (vars []
    (iif (= n 0)
         (return acc)
         (return (fact-h (- n 1) (* n acc))))))
```
- tail recursive
- current stack frame is no longer needed
- can be reused instead of creating a new one
- no space overhead
- similar optimization for *any* function call in tail position
- many imperative language compilers don't do this
- functional language compilers largely do

### Further Enhancements
- global mutable variables
  - not difficult
  - initialization?
    - by constants? easy
    - by exprs?
      - if these exprs have side effects, order of init matters
    - declaration-before-use?
