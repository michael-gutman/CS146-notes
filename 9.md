#### Recall: Pointers in C
More sophisticated input: scanf
  - scanf("%d", x); (wrong)
  - reads x as a decimal int
  - skips leading whitespace
  - scanf is a fn, cant modify x

Instead: ```scanf("%d", &x)```
- ```scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);```
- space in-between skips any amount of whitespace, including zero
- scanf returns the number of objects actually read
- lots of options
- scanf is very complicated

### Advanced Mutation
- Mutating Structures and Lists

#### In Scheme:
- can mutate parts of a cons with set-car! and set-cdr!

#### In Racket:
- cons fields are **immutable**
- cannot be mutated

#### For mutable pairs:
- Racket provides mcons
- mset-car!, mset-cdr!

#### For structs:
- ```(struct posn (x y) #:mutable)```

##### Semantics
- (posn v1 v2) cannot be a simple value if it is mutable
  - structs were values, just like numbers
  - cannot change value of 3 to 4
- has to behave more like a box

##### How?
- is a struct automatically boxed?
- is a struct a box?

#### Some experimentation
```
(struct posn (x y) #:mutable #:transparent)

(define (mutate-posn p)
  (set-posn-x! p (+ 1 (posn-x p))))

(define (mutate-posn2 p)
  (set! p (posn (+ 1 (posn-x p)) (posn-y p))))

(define p (posn 1 2))
(define q (posn 1 2))

(mutate-posn p)
(mutate-posn2 q)

p -> (posn 2 2)
q -> (posn 1 2)
```
- Posns themselves do not sit inside of boxes
- Posns DO act as boxes for their fields

So, a struct is not automatically boxed, but it does box its contents.  
So we can write:
```
(posn v1 v2)
```
as
```
(define _u1 v1)
(define _u2 v2)
(posn _u1 _u2)
```
- Recall - no expansion of \_u
- We know from C this really means posn has 2 pointers inside of it
- (posn-x p) -> find the defn for \_u1, fetch the value
- (set-posn-x! p v) -> find (define \_u1 ..), replace .. with v

```
(define p (posn 3 4))
(set-posn-x! p 5)

-> (define _u1 3)
   (define _u2 4)
   (define p (posn _u1 _u2))
   (set-posn-x! p5)

-> ...
   (set-posn-x! (posn _u1 _u2) 5)

-> (define _u1 5)
   (define _u2 4)
   (define p (posn _u1 _u2))
   (void)
```
- generalize to any mutable struct, mcons

#### Consider
```
(define lst1 (cons (box 1) empty))
(define lst2 (cons 2 lst1))
(define lst3 (cons 3 lst1))

(set-box! (first (rest lst2)) 4)

(unbox (first (rest lst3)))
```
- By the CS145 model - should produce ```1```
- But in fact you get ```4```

Why:
- lst2 = ```(cons 2 (cons (box 1) empty))```
- lst3 = ```(cons 2 (cons (box 1) empty))```
- But the two boxes are actually the same object
- lst2 and lst3 share the same tail

Could never tell this before, need mutation to see
```
(define _u1 1)
ls2 = (cons 2 (cons _u1 empty))
ls3 = (cons 3 (cons _u1 empty))
```
- old rules: get the wrong answer 1
- our rules - boxes rewritten as a separate define with deferred lookup

#### Rethinking define
```
(define x 3) (set! x 7) x
-> (define x 7) (void) x
-> 7
```
- Not just a replacement of all x's with 3
- otherwise we would have gotten a 3

##### x is not just a value
- something we can mutate
- an entity we can access
- x must denote a *location*, and the location contains the value

### So:
- We don't just have one lookup 𝛿: var -> value
- we have *two* lookups:
  - var -> location
  - location -> value
- set! changes the location -> value map
- But nothing changes the var -> location map
- Similarly, set-box! changes the location -> val mapping
- (define ...) creates a location, fills it with a value

## In C:
```C
int main() {
  int x = 1;
  int *y = &x;
  int *z = y;
  *y = 2;
  *z = 3;
  printf("%d %d %d\n", x, *y, *z);
}
```
#### Output: ```3 3 3```
##### Why?
- y is initialized to x's address
  - y points to the location of x
- z is initialized equal to y
  - Thus, z is also equal to x's address
- \*y = 2 -> store 2 at x's location -> ```x == *y == *z == 2```
- \*z = 3 -> store 3 at x's location -> ```x == *y == *z == 3```
- x, *y, *z, are three different names for same data

##### Called Aliasing
- Accessing the same data by different names

Can be subtle:
```C
void f(int *x, int *y) {
  *y == *x + 1;
  if (*y == *x) {
    printf("How could this ever print?\n");
  }
}

int main() {
  int z = 1;
  f(&z, &z);
  printf("%d\n, z");
}
```
- Makes \*x and \*y aliases
- Will print
- Makes programs very difficult to understand
