- GCD using only subtraction

#### SIMP
```
(seq (while (not (= a b))
     (iif (> a b)
          (set a (- a b))
          (set b (- b a))))
      (print a))
```
#### MMIXAL
```
  a  IS  $0
  b  IS  $1
gcd  CMP $2,a,b // assume $0 holds a and $1 holds b
     BNZ $2,end
     BN  $2,less
     SUB a,a,b
     JMP gcd
less SUB b,b,a
     JMP gcd
end  ??? print?
```

## Software Interrupts
- making things happen
- TRAP (opcode 00) execute "pre-installed" OS procedure

```
TRAO 0,FPuts,Stdout
```
- prints a string
- which string?
- the sting whose address is in $255

```
        GETA $255,String // puts String (labelled address) into $255
        TRAP 0,Fputs,StdOut
        TRAP 0,Halt,0
STRING  BYTE "Hello world!",#a,0
```
- hex a = dec 10 = newline
- 0 - null terminator

### Printing #'s?
- No built-in support
- have to build it yourself
- not very fun
- For simplicity - assume gcd is 2 digits

```
...
end GETA $255,Buf
     DIV $3,a,10 // $3 = gcd/10
    GETA $4,rR   // $4 = gcd%10
    INCL $3,'0'
    INCL $4,'0'
    STBU $3,$255,0 //store byte unsigned
    STBU $4,$255,1 //M[$255 + 1] <- $4
    TRAP 0,Fputs,StdOut
    TRAP 0,halt,0
buf BYTE "  ",#a,0 // buffer string    
```

### Starting the program
- label the starting point with a symbol Main, set the starting location
- Also, init $0 and $1

```
     LOC  4
   a IS   $0
   b IS   $1
Main SETL $0,48
     SETL $1,60
     ...
```

### Problem: Loading numbers into registers
- commands are 32 bits
- 8 bit opcode
- 8 bit register
- 16 bit for value
- but registers can hold 64 bits
- not enough room to load a reg with a 32 (or 64) bit value
- soln, set the reg 16 bits at a time
- SETH   $X, val - set the high wyde (bits 48-63)
- SETMH  $X, val - set the med-high (bits 32-47)
- SETML  $X, val - set the med-low  (bits 16-31)
- SETL  $X, val - set low wyde (bits 0-15)

So to set $0 = 48, $1 = 60
```
    XOR  $0,$0,$0 // $0 XOR $0 = 0000000...
    SETL $0,48
    XOR  $1,$1,$1
    SETL $1,60
```

### RAM access
- all operations are on regs + immediates
- data in RAM - must load into regs first

```
     LDB  $X,$Y,$Z // $X <- M[$Y + $Z]
     LDW  $X,$Y,$Z
     LDT   ...
     LDO   ...
     // similarly
     STB
     STW
     STT
     STO
```

### Problem with branches and jumps
- only have so much space for operations
- some addresses are to ofar away to jump/branch to

```
GO $X,$Y,$Z // $X<-@, @<-$Y+$Z
```
- "jump" based on the contents of regs $Y + $Z
  - full 64-bit addr space is available
- also: $X stores where the program would have gone next
  - so GO $X,$X,0 returns
- can use for subroutine call/return

## Command-line Arguments
- ./myprogram 10 20
- cat hello.txt
  - cat - myprogram
  - hello.txt - argument

### In C:
```
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {}
```
- argc = number of command line args; always > 0
- argv = the command-line args
- argv[0] = program name
- argv[argc] = NULL

### IN MMIX:
Follows the C model
- $0 = argc
- $1 = argv

## Writing an MMIX Simulator
- similar to PRIMP simulator
  - more state
    - memory, regs, PC (@), Halted?

### dispatch
- decode the itneger to an instr
- recover opcodes (numbers)
- dispatch on opcode #'s - just use a vector

```
(define operations (vector trap fcmp fun feql fadd ...))
```
- elems are fns that implement these operations

```
(define (dispatch-inst op t s1 s2)
  ((vector-ref operations op) t s1 s2))
```
- etc, similar to PRIMP sim

\*This simulator will not make reg access faster than mem access

### Processors: memory access (slow)
- Stall?
- Do other instrs in the meantime? (that don't depend on the memory)
- Compiler - arrange instructions to improve execution time
