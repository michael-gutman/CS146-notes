### Memory and Vectors
#### Recall:
- Memory - set of numbered "slots"
- address and contents
- each 'box': 8 bits, (one byte)
- usually treated in groups of 4-byte words

#### Primitive data structure: the array
- a "slice" of memory
- sequence of consecutive memory locations

#### Racket (also Scheme): The Vectors
- used much like a traditional array
- unlike traditional arrays - can hold items of any size (unlimited integers, strings, whatever)

### Vectors in Racket
```
(define x (vector 'blue true "you"))
```
- 3-item vector

```
name  address   contents
  x     0       .......
        1       .......
        2       .......
        3       .......
      ....
      length chosen by the program
              <--------> width - any value?
```

```
(define y (make-vector 100))
```
- make a vector of length 100
```
-> (vector 0 0 0 0 ....)
```

```
(define z (build-vector 100 sqr))
-> 0 1 4 .... 99^2

(define y (make-vector 100 5))
-> 5 5 5 5 5 ... x 100
```
#### Working with Vectors
```
(define y (make-vector 100 5))
(vector-ref y 7) -> 5
(vector-set! y 7 42)
(vector-ref y 7) -> 42
```
- access and mutate items by index (starting at 0)

##### Main advantage of vectors over lists - constant time
- ```vector-ref```, ```vector-set!``` run in O(1) time

##### Disadvantages
- Size is fixed
- difficult to add or remove items
- ```vector-set!``` tends to force an imperative style

Making our own build vector
```
(define (my-build-vector n f)
  (define res (make-vector n))
  (define (mbv-h i)
    (cond [(= i n) res]
          [else (vector-set! res i (f i))
                (mbv-h (+ i 1))]))
  (mbv-h 0))
```
- Very imperative
- There isn't a good way to do it not imperatively

##### Vectors work well with imperative-style algorithms
- ```for```, ```for/vector``` "macros" facilitate this

eg
```
(define (my-build-vector n f)
  (define res (make-vector n))  
  (for ([i n])
    (vector-set! res i (f i)))
  res)
```
or, just:
```
(define (my-build-vector n f)
  (for/vector ([i n]) (f i)))
```

sum the elements of a vector
```
(define (sum-vector vec)
  (define (sv-h i acc)
    (cond [(= i ((vector-length vec)) acc)]
          [else (sv-h (+ 1 i)
                      (+ acc (vector-ref vec i)))]))
  (sv-h 0 0))
```
- very loop-like

So:
```
(define (sum-vector vec)
  (define sum 0)
  (for ([i (vector-length vec)]
       (set! sum (+ sum (vector-ref vec i)))))
  sum)
```
- Looks very similar to what it would look like in C (minus the brackets)
- Not pure functional - uses mutation
- But it **looks** pure functional
- use of mutation confined to the internals of sum-vector
- can't be detected outside the fn (no printing, not clear)
- so outsiders could consider it pure functional

##### Provides a strategy for keeping the problems with mutation under control - hide it behind a pure functional interface

#### Recall: Memory vs Racket Vectors
- Memory only holds fixed-size data
  - unlimited integers? strings?
  - How does this work?

##### Recall (an analogy):
```
(define (mutate-posn p)
  (set-posn-x! p (+ 1 (posn-x p))))

(define p (posn 3 5))
(mutate-posn p)
(posn-x p) -> 4
```
vs
```C
void mutate(struct Posn p) {
  p.x += 1;
}
int main(){
  struct Posn p = {3,5};
  mutate(p);
  printf("%d\n", p.x); -> 3
}
```
- Rackets structs and C structs are different
- Passing a Racket struct to mutate-posn works, but not in C
- The struct is copied but changes to the field still persist
- The fields of a Racket struct are 'boxed'
  - They're pointers

Similarly, the items in a Racket vector are *addresses* that point to the actual contents (which can be of any size)

Similarly, the fields of a cons are pointers

Also, since Racket is dynamically typed, the values ```1```, ```'blue```, ```true``` must somehow include type information (more later).

### "Vectors" in C: Arrays
- An array is a sequence of consecutive memory locations

```C
int main() {
  int grades[10]; //An array of 10 ints
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", &grades[i]);
  }
  int acc;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    acc += grades[i];
  }
  printf("%d\n", acc/10);
}
```
- ```a[i]``` = access the ith element of array a
- ```int grades[10]``` - valid entries are ```grades[0], ... , grades[9]```

What happens if you go out of bounds?
- undefined behaviour
- in principle, anything is possible
- certain behaviours are more likely
- could be nothing happens, could be your program works, could be you change other variables, could be your program crashes (more likely)
- expect a crash, or maybe not

Will it stop you? No.
- C says "You're an adult. You know how long the array is. If you want to walk off the end of a cliff, go ahead."
- program may or may not crash
  - if not, data may be corrupted; no way to detect it.

Can give the bound implicitly:
```C
int main() {
  int grades[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
  printf("%zd\n", sizeof(grades)/sizeof(int));
}
```
- sizeof = the amount of memory occupied - evaluated by the compiler
- ```sizeof(grades)``` should be 20 bytes
- ```sizeof(int)``` = 4 bytes
- data type = size_t, %zd

#### Functions on arrays:
```C
int sum(int arr[], int size) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) res += arr[i];
  return res;
}
```
- sizeof doesn't work here
- Can't know how long an array is, have to tell it

Passing arrays by value ->
- Copying the entire array
- Expensive

C will not do this.
```C
int main() {
  int myArray[100];
  ...
  int total = sum(myArray, 100);
  ...
}
```
- How is this not a copy?
- 'Most confusing rule in all of C':
  - The name of an array is shorthand for a pointer ot its first element
