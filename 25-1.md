## Adding Both Arrays and Functions to SIMP

### SIMP-FAC
- SIMP with Functions (and) Arrays (like) C
- Arrays as local function variables
  - Stored on stack
  - return local array (ptr) from a function -> dangling ptr
- Arrays as arguments
  - pass a ptr to the first item

```
(A (make-array 5 0))
->
(data _A _CONTENTS_A)   ; 500
(data SIZE_A 5)         ; 501
(data CONTENTS_A (5 0)) ; 502
```
- Passing \_A as parameter P
  - P will be 502
  - just like passing anything else

#### Can we return an entire array from a function?
- (later)

## Lists in PRIMP
- Lists of integers | 6 -|> 4 | -|> 3 |\\|
- A-PRIMP

```
(const EMPTY 0)
(data NODE3 6 NODE2)
(data NODE2 4 NODE1)
(data NODE1 3 EMPTY)
```
- Don't have to be in order or consecutive
- probably isn't actually consecutive in memory
- when traversing a linked list, probably jumping all over memory

#### Sum the #s in a list
- A-PRIMP

```
(move P LIST)
(move SUM 0)
(label LOOP)
(eq TMP0 P EMPTY)
(branch TMP0 DONE)
(add SUM SUM P)
(move P (1 P))
(jump LOOP)
(label DONE)
```
- C

```C
struct node *p = lst;
int sum = 0;
while (p) {
  sum += p->data;
  p = p->next;
}
```

### How do we create lists at runtime in PRIMP?
- How do we write cons?

#### Need to implement the heap
Simple strategy
- set aside a large chunk of memory
- and a ptr to the next unallocated location - "allocation ptr"
- cons -> advance the allocation ptr by 2 locations
  - return  the first location in the pair, fill with first/rest

### What happens when we run out of heap space?
- maybe some old cons cells no longer needed

One approach
- keep a "free" list
- when a cons is no longer needed, add to free list
- (change in allocation strategy - take from the free list if possible, else go to rest of the heap)

How do we know a cons cell is no longer needed?
- easiest - programmer frees it
  - burden on programmer
  - doesn't work well with funciotnla programming
- or - garbage collection

- free list works well if we only allocate cons cells (ie all the same size)
  - what if we wnat different sizes?
    - Need to have some kind of size associated with each cell
  - what if we want lists if lists?
    - theres no wa to tell numbers from locations
    - is the data field an int or a ptr to a cons cell?

### Make a cons cell 3 locations
- type | first | rest

```
(const INT-TYPE 0)
(const CONS_TYPE 1)
(data NODE4 CONST_TYPE NODE2 NODE3)
(data NODE3 INT_TYPE 3 EMPTY)
(data NODE2 INT_TYPE 2 NODE1)
(data NODE1 INT_TYPE 1 EMPTY)
```

#### More generally - need to tag ALL values with their types
