#### Recall:
- The name of an array is shorthand for a poointer to its first element.
- ```myArray``` is shorthand for ```&myArray[0]```

But sum is expecting an array not a ptr: ```int sum(int a[], int size);```  
Why not ```int sum(int *a, int size)```;?
- ```int *arr``` and ```int arr[]``` are identical *in parameter declarations*

Let's take a look at sum again:
```C
int sum(int *arr, int size) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) res += arr[i];
  return res;
}
```
- If its expecting a pointer, can we still do ```arr[i]```?
  - Yes

### Pointer Arithmetic
- Let t be a type
- ```t arr[10];```
- ```sizeof(arr) = 10*sizeof(t)```
- ```arr``` is shorthand for ```&arr[0]```
  - ```*arr``` is equivalent to ```arr[0]```

What expression produces a pointer to ```arr[1]```?
- ```arr + 1``` is shorthand for ```&arr[1]```
- ```arr + 2``` is shorthand for ```&arr[2]```
- etc
- Numerically ```arr + n``` produces the address equal to ```arr + n*sizeof(t)```

If ```arr + k``` is shorthand for ```&arr[k]``` then ```*(arr[k])``` means ```arr[k]```

Therefore we could do:
```C
int sum (int *arr, int size) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) res += *(arr + i);
  return res;
}
```

- In fact, ```a[k]``` is just shorthand for ```(a+k)```
- Note: addition is commutative, so:
  - ```*(a + k) = *(k + a) = k[a]```

Now:
```C
int sum(int *arr, int size) {
  int res = 0;
  for (int *cur = arr; cur < arr + size; ++cur) res += *cur;
  return res;
}
```
- point at the array, and walk the pointer through it

##### Any pointer can be thought of as pointing to the beginning of an array
- Same syntax for accessing items through an array as through a pointer
- So: arrays and pointers are the same thing?
  - **NO!**

```C
int f(int arr[]) {
  printf("%zd\n", sizeof(arr));
}

int main() {
  int myArray[10];
  printf("%zd\n", sizeof(myArray));
  f(myArray);
}
```
Prints:  
40 -size of the array  
8  -size of a ptr to the array

##### Compiler:
`myArray[i]`
- fetch myArray location in env
- add i*sizeof(int)
- fetch this address from store

`arr[i]`
- fetch arr loc in env
- fetch my array addr from store
- add i*sizeof(int) to addr
- fetch item value from store

----
We saw that a Racket struct ```(struct posn x y)``` is like a C struct whose fields are pointers. How can we achieve this in C?

Well, we can do:
```C
struct Posn {
  int *x;
  int *y
};

int main() {
  struct Posn p;
  //What are p.x and p.y pointing at?
  *p.x = 3;
  *p.y = 4;
}
```
- Crashes (most likely)
- p.x and p.y are uninitialized pointers
- They point at arbitrary locations, dictated by whatever value they happen to hold

So (posn 3 4) must also reserve memory for x and y to point at, to hold the 3 and 4.
- Need to do the same in C

```C
#include <stdlib.h>
struct Posn makePosn(int x, int y) {
  struct Posn p;
  p.x = malloc(sizeof(int));
  p.y = malloc(sizeof(int));
  *p.x = x;
  *p.y = y;
  return p;
}
```
- ```malloc(n)``` = request n bytes of memory

```C
struct Posn p = makePosn(3, 40); //OK
```
