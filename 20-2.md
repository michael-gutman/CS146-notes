# Module 3: PRIMP
So far- our abstract syntax is stored in S-expressions, basically tree-structured data.

But, trees are an abstraction- basic machine has only memory, not trees.

Let us now store our programs in a vector.

### Now:
- A program is a *sequence* of instructions.
- The RAM used for data will be the same RAM that holds the program.
- Reasoning about the program- No more rewriting.
  - Program remains fixed.
  - SO we need to keep track of where we are in the program
- Index into the program - called the program counter (PC)
  - Holds the location of the next statement (instruction) to be executed

### Simulator
- runs a fetch-execute cycle
- Repeat:
  - Fetch the instruction at the location given by PC
  - Increment PC
  - Execute the fetched instruction
- For Clarity - PC is a separate variable, outside of the RAM that holds our program
- No named vars - Locations in real RAM don't have names
  - variables referenced by Location
  - starting right after the program
- Still allow unbounded integers (will fix in the next language)


- SIMP - allowed arbitrarily complex expressions
- PRIMP - one operation at a time - constant space instructions


- An arithmetic statement has 3 arguments:
  - 2 operands + a destination  
- Operands:
  - want to allow both numbers, 2, and locations, (2)
- eg ```(add (5) (1) (2))``` vs ```(add (7) (7) 1)```
  - -> "```M[5] <- M[1] + M[2]```" vs "```M[7] <- M[7] + 1```"

#### Operations
- add
- sub
- mul
- div
- mod
- equal
- not-equal
- gt
- ge
- lt
- le
- land
- lor
- lnot

- PRIMP vector entries can be integer or boolean (another lie)

- move - ```(move (10) (12))``` = "```M[10]<-M[12]```"


#### Loops and ifs
- Program is no longer tree-structured
- How will you know where to go?
