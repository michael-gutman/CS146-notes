oneStep::Ast->Ast
oneStep (Bin op (Number v) (Number w)) = Number (opTrans op v w)
oneStep (Bin op (Number v) y) = Bin op (Number v) (oneStep y)
oneStep (Bin op x y) = Bin op (oneStep x) y
oneStep (App (Fun fp fb) (Number v)) = subst v fp fb
oneStep (App (Fun fp fb) x) = App (Fun fp fb) (oneStep x)
oneStep (App f x) = App (oneStep f) x

allSteps::Ast->Val
allSteps (Number v) = Numb v
allSteps (Fun fp fb) = Fn fp fb
allSteps x = allSteps(onestep x)
```
- allSteps - already tail recursive
- oneStep - not tail recursive
  - but - each case has only one tail recursive call
  - "after"work is just applying a data constructor
  - so its close

#### Inefficiencies
1. Finding the redex - search the AST everytime
2. Substituiton is expensive

Recall - Why is finding the redex expensive
```
(append '(1 2 3) '(4 5))
-> (cons 1 (append '(2 3) '(4 5)))
-> (cons 1 (cons 2 (append '(3) '(4 5))))
-> (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (append '() '(4 5)))))
-> (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '(4 5))))
```
- The redex - the part we can reduce - is the append
- It gets deeper and deeper every time
- In this case (append) could keep moving "forward" as the new "append" redex is always "ahead" of us
- But how do we ascend?
- In general, eg arithmetic - need to "come out" of the subexpr to reduce other branches.
- How do we "back up" efficiently?
- Doubly linked lists - Can move forward and backward in O(1) everytime
  - requires mutation to set up (Haskell doesn't have mutation)
  - We can use 2 lists - ahead and seen (or 'context')

```
data Cxt a = F a (Cxt a) | MT
type CList a ([a], Cxt a)

[1,2,3,4] -> ([1,2,3,4], MT)
    forward: ([2,3,4], F 1 MT)
    forward: ([3,4], F 2 (F 1 MT))

forward:: CList a -> CList a
forward ([], _) = error "can't move forward"
forward (x:xs, c) = (xs, F x c)

back:: CList a -> CList a
back (_, MT) = error "can't move backward"
back (xs, F x c) = (x:xs, c)
```
- exercise - insert/delete/change item in a context list

Same technique works for traversing trees
- context contains more info
 - did we descend to the left or right?
 - what is the other branch?

```
data BTree a = Empty|Node a (BTree a) (BTree a)
data Cxt a = L a (BTree a) (Cxt a)|R a (BTree a) (Cxt a)|MT
type CBTree a = (BTree a, Cxt a)
```
Context still "list-like" - single recusion
```
moveLeft::CBtree a -> CBTree a
moveLeft (Empty, _) = error "no left subtree"
moveLeft (Node a l r, c) = (l, L a r c)

moveRight::CBtree a -> CBTree a
...
moveUp::CBtree a -> CBTree a
...
```
- exercise - right and up

This data structure is called a **zipper**.

When building context for an interpreter - what you get is called a **continuation**.

```
data cont = MT | AppL Ast Cont | AppR Val Cont
               | BinL Op Ast Cont | BinR Op Val Cont
```

Add the continuation as an extra param to the recursion (like an accumulator)

```
interp (Bin op x y) c = interp x (BinL op y c)
interp (App f x) c = interp f (AppL x c)
```
otherwise
- the AST denotes a value
- apply the continuation to the value

```
interp x c = applyCont c x

applyCont::Cont->Val->Val
applyCont (BinL op y k) x = interp y (BinR op x k)
applyCont (BinR Plus (Numb x) k) (Numb y) =
                          applyCont k (Numb (x + y))
applyCont (BinR Times (Numb x) k) (Numb y) =
                          applyCont k (Numb (x * y)
...
applyCont (AppL a k) f = interp a (AppR f k)
applyCont (AppR (Fun fp fb) k x) =
                          interp (subst fp x fb) k
applyCont MT x = x
```
- tail recursive (almost)
- can be turned into a loop
- no need for a stack
  - replaced by growing continuations
- but calls to substs are *not* tail recursive
  - and expensive
