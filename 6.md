### Recall
```
(lookup 'Brad)
; -> false
(add 'Brad 36484)
(lookup 'Brad)
; -> 36484
```
```
(define address-book empty)
(define (add name number)
  (set! address-book (cons (list name number) address-book)))
```

### Global Data
- Good for defining constants to be used repeatedly
- *But*, not good with mutation
- Any part of a program could change a global variable
- Therefore, a change affects the entire program
- Hidden dependencies between different parts of the program
  - Can't tell just by looking at one function that it affects another
  - ie, lookup and add are dependent but don't call each other
- Makes programs harder to reason about

#### Application: Memoization
- Caching
  - Saving the result of a computation to avoid repeating it
- Memoization
  - Maintaining a table of cached values

##### Consider
```
(define (fib n)
  (cond [(= n 0) 0]
        [(= n 1) 1]
        [else (+ (fib (- n 1))
                  (fib (- n 2)))]))
```
Inefficient because recursive calls repeated
- (fib 98) called twice
- (fib 97) called 3x
- etc

Avoid repetition - Keep an association of pairs (n, Fn)
```
(define fib-table empty)

(define (memo-fib n)
  (define result assoc n fib-table)
  (cond [result => second]
        [else
          (define fib-n
            (cond [(<= n 1) n]
                  [else (+ (memo-fib (- n 1))
                           (memo-fib (- n 2)))]))
          (set! fib-table (cons (list n fib-n)
                                fib-table))
          fib-n]))
```
##### Notes
- assoc - built-in fn for association list lookup
  - (assoc x lst) returns the pair (list x y) from lst, or #f
- any value can be used as a test
  - false is false; anything else is true
- (cond [x => f] - if x passes, i.e. is not false, produces (f x)
- Calls to (fib n) happen only once

fib-table
- global variable
- Access from outside can make memo-fib wrong
- Can we hide it?
```
(define memo-fib
  (local [(define fib-table empty)
          (define (memo-fib n) ...)]
        memo-fib))
```
Doesn't quite work for address book
- two fns need access to the global var
- but it can be done

### Mutation in C
Operator = performs mutation ("assignment operator")
```C
int main() {
  int x = 3; printf("%d\n", x);
  x = 4; printf("%d\n", x);
}
```
prints:  
3  
4

##### Note: = is an operator
- x = y is an expression
- it has a value as well as an effect
- its value is the value assigned
- x = 4 = sets x to 5 and has value 4

eg
```C
int main() {
  int x = 3
  printf("%d\", x);
  printf("%d\n", x = 4);
}
```
prints:  
3  
4
- Advantages - almost none
- Disadvantages - many

eg
- x = y = z = 7
- sets all x, y, z to 7

```C
int main() {
  int x = 5;
  if (x = 4) {
    printf("x is 4\n");
  }
  x = 0;
  if (x = 0) {
    printf("x is 0\n");
  }
}
```
- x = 4 sets x to 4, has value 4, non-zero
  - always prints x is 4
- x = 0 sets x to 0 again, value is 0 -> false
  - never prints x is 0
- Easy to confuse assignment with equality check
  - if (x == 4) ...
  - if (x == 0) ...
- Usually best to use assignment only as a statement

Can leave vars uninitialized and assign later
```C
int x; //uninitialized
x = 4;
```
- Not a good idea
- Do only with a very good reason

```C
int x;
if (x == 0) {
  ...
}
```
- Will it run or not?
- The value of an uninitialized var is undefined
- x most likely holds whatever the memory happened to hold before

### Global Variables
```C
in c = 0; //global variable

int f() { //returns 0, then 1, then 2, ...
  int d = c;
  c = c + 1;
  return d;
}

int main() {
  printf("%d\n", f());
  printf("%d\n", f());
  printf("%d\n", f());
}
```
0  
1  
2  

##### Careful:
```C
printf("%d\n%d\n%d\n", f(), f(), f());
```
- Could produce 0 1 2, or 2 1 0 or others  
- Order of evaluation is unspecified
- Never mutate and access the same variable in the same expression

As with the Racket fib table, can interfere with f by mutating c
- Can we protect c from access by fns other than f?

```C
int f() {
  static int c = 0; //A global variable that only f can see
  int d = c;
  c = c + 1;
  return d;
}
```

### Repetition
```C
void sayHiNTimes(int n) {
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("Hi\n");
    sayHiNTimes(n-1);
  }
}
```
Tail recursion
- is just repetition
