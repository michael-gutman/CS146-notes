### Recall: Boxes/addressbook

Boxes are built in to Racket,
Syntax:
```
exp = (box exp) <- make-bx
    | (unbox exp) <- get
    | (set-box! exp exp) <- set
```
Redefining addressbook using built-in Boxes
```
(define home (box '((Mom 45678) (sis 56789))))
(define work (box '((Boss 67890))))

(define (add abook name phone)
  (set-box! abook (cons '(name phone) (unbox abook))))
```
#### Semantics
```
(box v)
-> (define _u v)
```
Convention (Not Racket) - When we write an underscore before a var name it means the var's value is not looked up during expression evaluation, unless (unbox \__) is called on it.
```
(unbox _n) -> find (define _n v) -> v
(set-box _n v) -> find (define _n _) -> (define _n v) -> (void)
```
eg
```
(define box1 (box 4))
(unbox box1)
(set-box! box1 true)
(unbox box1)

-> (define _u1 4)
   (define box1 _u1)
   (unbox box1)
   (set-box! box1 true)
   (unbox box1)

-> (define _u1 4)
   (define box1 _u1)
   (unbox _u1)
   (set-box! box1 true)
   (unbox box1)

-> (define _u1 4)
   (define box1 _u1)
   4
   (set-box! box1 true)
   (unbox box1)

-> (define _u1 4)
   (define box1 _u1)
   4
   (set-box! _u1 true)
   (unbox box1)

-> (define _u1 true)
   (define box1 _u1)
   4
   (void)
   (unbox box1)

-> (define _u1 true)
   (define box1 _u1)
   4
   (unbox _u1)

-> (define _u1 true)
   (define box1 _u1)
   4
   true
```
- a bit messy - subst. model doesn't work well with mutation
- This problem we encounter is not an issue of Racket or C but an issue of imperative programming

#### The same problem in C
Suppose we want to write a fn:
```C
void inc(int x) {
  x = x + 1;
}
int main() {
  int x = 1;
  inc(x);
  printf("%d\n", x);
}
```
- Want: 2
- Get: 1
- Why? Imagine a substitution
  - There is no association between the passed x and the x in the fn
  - It is not x itself, but only the value is passed

#### Racket soln
- Put the variable in a box
- C doesn't have boxes, or lambdas

##### What is the C equivalent?
- One field structures

### Structs in C
```C
struct Posn {
  int x;
  int y;
};
```
- Ending semicolon *needed*
- Could create Posns while defining
```C
struct Posn {
  int x;
  int y;
} p1, p2, p3;
```
- Almost literally nobody does this

So:
```C
int main() {
  struct Posn p;
  p.x = 3;
  p.y = 4;
  printf("p=(%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y)
}
```
OR
```C
int main() {
  struct Posn p = {3, 4};
  printf("p=(%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y)
}
```
Now let's try something with structures
```C
void swap(struct Posn p) {
  int temp = p.x;
  p.x = p.y;
  p.y = temp;
}
int main() {
  struct Posn p = {3, 4};
  swap(p)
  printf("p=(%d, %d)\n", p.x, p.y)
}
```
- Want: p=(4, 3)
- Get: p=(3, 4) - still doesn't work
- The value of the struct is still passed, swap has no access to the original variable

#### The heart of the problem:
- C (and also Racket) passes paramteres by a mechanism called call-by-value
- The fn operates on a **copy** of the argument, not the argument itself
- The Racket substn model naturally implements call-by-value

```
(define x 3)
(f x) -> (f 3) - 3 is the value of x, not x itself
```
In C
```C
void inc(int x) {
  ++x;
}
```
- x really does get mutated
- but it is a copy of x, not the original from the caller
- original remains the same

Similarly:
```C
void swap(struct Posn p) {
  int temp = p.x;
  p.x = p.y;
  p.y = temp;
}
```
- The entire struct is copied into the function
- Original does not change

#### So there is something special about boxes
- The Racket substitution model does not explain them
- What we know about C so far cannot emulate them
- boxes are not equal to the value they hold
- but they tell you (know?) how to find the value (unbox)

#### Finding a value - where is it located?
- In memory (RAM)
- Every value in RAM has an address
- Given the address, can "find" the value
- So addresses could function as boxes
- instead of passing a value to a fn, pass an address

```C
int x = 1;
inc(&x);
printf("%d\n", x);
```
- & -> "address of" operator
- Passes x's address, not its value

```C
void inc(int x) { // Wrong now, didn't get int, got address
  x = x + 1;
}
```
- Maybe ```void inc(address x) {...}```? No.
- Want a guarantee that the address points to an int
- Need more info, what type of data is stored at that address
- Need to say "x is the adress of an int"

```C
void inc(int *p) { // p is called a pointer to an int
  p = p + 1 // Also wrong
}
```
- Legal, Will compile, Wrong
- Don't want to add 1 to the address
- Want to add 1 to the value stored at the address

#### Finally
```C
void inc(int *p) {

  *p = *p + 1
}
```
- \* = dereference operator (unbox)
- fetch the value stored at the addr (sort of)
- LHS of assign (\*x = exp) -> Store the value of exp at address x

##### Alternatives
```C
void inc(int *p) {
  *p += 1;
}
```
```C
void inc(int *p) {
  ++*p;
}
```
but
```C
void inc(int *p) {
  *p++; //wrong
}
```
- Postfix before prefix in C
- ++ happens first, then \*
- means \*(p++) - increase the address/pointer and fetch the value at the *original* address (and do nothing with it)
- No change to the original variable

#### Now Consider
```C
void swap(struct Posn p) {
  int temp = p.x;
  p.x = p.y;
  p.y = temp;
}
```
Fix by passing a pointer
```C
void swap(Struct posn *p){
  int temp = *p.x;
  *p.x = *p.y;
  *p.y = temp;
  // WRONG again, post-fix before pre-fix
}
```
- \*p.x = \*p.y means \*(p.x) = \*(p.y) = nonsense

Needs parens
```C
void swap(Struct posn *p){
  int temp = (*p).x;
  (*p).x = (*p).y;
  (*p).y = temp;
}
```
- (\*p).x is common enough that it has its own notation
- p->x means (*p).x

```C
void swap(Struct posn *p){
  int temp = p->x;
  p->x = p->y;
  p->y = temp;
}
```
