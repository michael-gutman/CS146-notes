### ASSEMBLER (assignment)
#### 2 Phases
1. Build a hash table of all symbols as keys. Values may not yet be known
2. Fill in the values. Watch out for circular definitions

Then produce the PRIMP program.

### Converting SIMP to A-PRIMP ("compiler")

Consider:
```
(vars [(x 3)] (print x))
```
-->
```
(print-val x)
(halt)
(data x 3)
```
- Make sure you never invent a var/label called x!
- Convention: prefix SIMP vars with _
- Then don't generate vars/labels starting with _

```
(vars [(x 3)] (print x))
```
-->
```
(print-val _x)
(halt)
(data _x 3)
```
In General:
```
(vars [(xi xn) ...]
  stmt...)
```
-- Compiler -->
```
...Code for stmt...
(halt)
(data _xi ni)
temp. storage
```
Why temp storage?

Consider ```(+ exp1 exp2)```
- recursively emit code to eval exp1 and exp2.
- then add
- need to store the first value somewhere, while computing the seconds
- after summing, temp storage is no longer needed
- Could just create a separate location for every possible temp

#### Better: use a stack
- use a data stmt to create a var sp (stack ptr) that holds the location of the first unused spot in the stack

How do we put something on the stack?
- ```(move SP 5)``` - Stores 5 in SP not on the stack
- ```(move (sp) 5)``` - not (currently) legal, double de-refrence
- This is a problem

What if we want to fetch a value?
```
(move A (-1 SP))
(move B (-2 SP))
```
- Not currently legal, but wouldn't it be nice?
- Well, lets add

### Let's add to PRIMP (cheating a bit)
- (well, lets say oops, we forgot that PRIMP already had this)
  - (not cheating)

Define ```(offset LABEL)``` = ```M[offset + M[LABEL]]```
```
(add (10) (-1 (59)) 1)
= M[10] <- M[-1 + M[59]] + 1
```
- If SP = 59, fetches top item on the stack

```
(move (-1 (59)) 0)
```
- replaces top item with 0

```
(move (0 (59)) 0)
(add (59) (59) 1)
```
- Pushes to the top of the stack

In SP:
```
(move (0 SP)) 0)
(add SP SP 1)
```

To compile ```(set var exp)```
- Compile the code to compute exp
- Code that pops the value on top of the stack, moves it to the location associated with the variable

```
(iif exp stmt1 stmt2)
```
-- >
```
exp-code
(branch dest LABEL0) ; where dest is exp-code val location
(jump LABEL1)
(label LABEL0)
stmt1-Code
(jump LABEL2)
(label LABEL1)
stmt2-code
(label LABEL2)
```

```
(while exp stmt...)
```
-->
```
(label LABEL0)
exp-code
(branch dest LABEL1)
(jump LABEL2)
(label LABEL1)
stmts-code
(jump LABEL0)
(label LABEL2)
```

### Adding Arrays to SIMP
- Thanks to offset dereferencing

```
(vars [(sum 0) (A (array 1 2 3 4 5)) (i 0)]
  (while (< i 5)
    (set sum (+ sum (array-ref A i)))
    (set i (+ i 1)))
  (print sum))
```
How do we translate ```(array-ref A i)``` into PRIMP?
- Add i to the address of the 0th elem of A, then fetch from memory (remember: ```*(A+i)```)
- Similarly for array-set

```
(label LOOP_TOP)
(lt TMP1 I 5)
(branch TMP1 LOOP_CONT)
(jump LOOP_DONE)
(label LOOP_CONT)
(add  SUM SUM (_A I))
(add I I 1)
(jump LOOP_TOP)
(label LOOP_DONE)
(print-val SUM)
(halt)
(data SUM 0)
(data I 0)
(data TMP1 0)
(data _A 1 2 3 4 5)
```
Can we signal an error if an array-ref is out of bounds?
```
(A (array 1 2 3 4 5))
```
-- >
```
(data SIZE_A 5)
(data _A 1 2 3 4 5)
```

```
(array-ref A I)
```
-->
```
(array-ref A I)
```
-->

```
(lt TMP0 _I 0)
(branch TMP0 INDEX_ERROR)
(ge TMP0 _I SIZE_A)
(branch TMP0 INDEX_ERROR)
(move TMP0 (_A _I))
```

```
(array-set A I I)
```
- similar
- safer but less efficient
- superfluous in the above program, loop bound of 5 guarantees that all array accesses are safe

## Strings in C
- C has no string type
- Strings in C are arrays of characters

```C
char myString[] = "Hello";
```
Recall: The size of an array is not stored as part of the array
```C
int f (char arr[]) {...}
```
- passed as ptr
- no indication of size

Convention: Char arrays that denote strings end with the character '\\0' (ASCII 0) that signals the end of the string

So,
```C
char myString[] = "Hello"; //'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' '\0'
//sizeof(myString) == 6, not 5
```
