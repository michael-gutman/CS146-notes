### Recall
```C
void sayHiNTimes(int n) {
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("Hi\n");
    sayHiNTimes(n-1);
  }
}
```
- Tail recursion is just repetition
- Expressed more idiomatically as

```C
void sayHiNTimes(int n) {
  while (n > 0) {
    printf("Hi\n");
    n = n - 1
  }
}
```
- a loop- the body of the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true

##### In General
```C
void f(int c) {
  if (cont(c)) { //continuation condition
    body(c);
    f(update(c));
  }
}
```
becomes
```C
void f(int c) {
  while (cont(c)) {
    body(c);
    c = update(c);
  }
}
```
- may not need to be in its own fn anymore, if used only once

### Accumulators
```C
int f(int c, int acc) {
  if (cont(c)) {
    body(c, acc);
    return f(update1(c), update2(c, acc));
  }
  return g(acc)
}
f(acc0)
```
becomes
```C
int acc = acc0
while (cont(c)) {
  body(c, acc);
  acc = update2(acc, c);
  c = update1(c);
}
acc = g(acc)
```
- It is always a tail recursive computation that is turned into a loop
- Much harder to do with a computation that is not tail recursive

##### Eg
```C
int getIntHelper(int acc) {
  char c = getchar();
  if (isdigit(c))
    return getIntHelper(10 * acc + c - '0');
  return acc;
}
int getInt() {
  return getIntHelper(0);
}
```
- This is tail recursive, so this should be writeable as a loop

```C
int acc = 0;
char c = getchar();
while (isdigit(c)) {
  acc = 10 * acc + c - '0';
  c = getchar();
}
```
- This version doesn't technically burn a character since 'c' is still accessible

#### Common patterns emerge
When writing these functions, a common pattern emerges
```
(init variables)
while (condition) {
  (body)
  (update variables)
}
```
Alternative 'for'mat
```
for (init ; condition ; update) {
  body
}
```
Let's write getInt like This
```C
int acc = 0
char c;
for (c = getchar(); isdigit(c); c=getchar()) {
  acc = 10 * acc + c - '0';
}
```
or even:
```C
int acc = 0
for (char c = getchar(); isdigit(c); c = getchar()) {
  acc = 10 * acc + c - '0';
}
```
- Even more succinct, and nice to create and init together
- But changes the meaning of the program slightly
- Second version has limited the scope of c to loop only, c is gone after the loop terminates

or even
```C
int acc = 0;
for (char c = getchar(); isdigit(c); acc = 10 * acc + c - '0', c = getchar());
```
- comma operator
- semicolon indicating empty loop body
- Not good Usually, hard to read, not point
- could be useful if body depends on two counters

##### Peekchar version
```C
int acc = 0;
for (char c = peekchar(); isdigit(c); acc = 10 * acc + getchar() - '0', c = peekchar());
```
- When using peekchar, have to use getchar again after

or
```C
int acc = 0;
for (char c = peekchar(), isdigit(c); c = (getchar(), peekchar())) {
  acc = 10 * acc + c - '0';
}
```
- Most explicit, showing you need to use getChar() and peekChar() again

#### Updating Counters
- c = c + 1;
- c = c - 2;
- c = 10 * c;
- c = c/2;
- c = c + d;

Specialized syntax:
- c += 1;
- c -= 2;
- c \*= 10;
- c /= 2;
- c += d;

Increment/decrement by 1:
- ++c;
- --c;

These are expressions - they have a value as well as an effect
- ++c; increments c and produces the value of c
- --c; similarly
- Which value? The old one or the new one?
```C
int i = 1;
printf("%d\n", ++1);
```
- prints 2, the new value
- postfix versions, i++, i--
- increment and decrement - but produce the old value
- implies old value must be remembered
- if you use increment/decrement operators, prefer the prefix versions

### More on global Data
- global variables
  - int i = 0;
  - avoid where possible, creates hidden dependencies
- Global constants still useful, can force a varable to remain constant in cs
  - const int passingGrade = 50;
  - cannot be mutated
***
### Intermediate Mutation (Racket)
What if we want to work with multiple address books?
```
(define work '(("Manager" 12345)
               ("director" 23456)))
(define home '())
```
When adding an entry, want to indicate which address book to add it to
```
(define (add-entry abook name number)
  (set! abook (cons (list name number) abook)))

(add-entry home 'Neighbour 34567)
home -> '()
```
- Nothing changed, doesn't work
- Not clear how to make it work
- substitution model doesn't explain behaviour
- substitution doesn't even make sense
```
(add-entry home "neighbour" 34567)
; subst '() for home in body ->
(set! '() (cons (list "neighbour" 34567) '()))
```

To make this work...  
Recall from CS145 - simulation of structs using lambda  
Do the same thing to create a struct with one field
- Called a box
- two operations
  - get the value in the box
  - set the value to a new value

```
(define (make-box v)
  (lambda (msg)
    (cond [(equal? msg 'get) v])))

(define (get b) (b 'get))

(define b1 (make-box 7))
(get b1)
-> (define b1 (lambda (msg)
                (cond [(equal? msg 'get) 7])))
   (get b1)
-> (get (lamda (msg) (cond ...)))
-> (lambda (msg) (cond ....) 'get)
-> (cond [(equal? 'get 'get) 7])
-> 7
```
Also need to support set - introduce a local copy of v so that we can mutate
```
(define (make-box v)
  (define val v)
  (lambda (msg)
    (cond [(equal? msg 'get) val])))

(define (get b) (b 'get))

(define b1 (make-box 7))
(get b1)
-> (define val_1 7)
   (define b1 (lambda (msg)
                (cond [(equal? msg 'get) val_1])))
   (get b1)
-> ....... -> 7
```
Adding set
- requires an extra param
- achieve by having the box return a fn

```
(define (make-box v)
  (define val v)
  (define (msg)
    (cond [(equal? msg 'get) val]
          [(equal? msg 'set)
           (lambda (newv) (set! val newv))])))

(define (get b) (b 'get))
(define (set b v) ((b 'set) v))

(define b1 (make-box 7))
(set b1 4)
-> (define val_1 7)
   (define b1 (lambda (msg) .... val_1 ...))
   (set b1 4)
-> (define val_1 7)
   ...
   ((b1 'set) 4)
-> (define val_1 7)
   ...
   ((lambda (newv) (set! val_1 newv)) 4)
-> (define val_1 7)
   ...
   (set! val_1 4)
-> (define val_1 4)
   ...
   (void)
```
How does this fix the addr book?
Before
```
(add home ... ...)
-> (add '() ... ...)
-> (set! '() ...) cant update home
```
Now
```
(define home (make-box '()))

(define (add abook name num)
  (set abook (cons (list name num)
                   (get abook))))

(add home ... ...)
```
