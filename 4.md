# Input Cont'd
What have we lost by accepting input?
- referential transparency
   - The same expression has the same value whenever it is evaluated

Example:  
(f 4) always produces the same value  
```Scheme
(let ((z (f 4))) body)
```
- every z in body can be replaced by (f 4) and vice versa. "equals can be substituted for equals"

#### Not true anymore!
- (read) doesnt always produce the same value!
- Makes it harder to reason about programs
   - Simple algebraic manipulation is no longer possible

# Intro to C
### Expressions, Statements, Blocks, Functions, Program

##### Expressions:
- ```1 + 2``` - infix operator - precedence
- ```f(7) - function call```
- ```printf("%d\n", 5)```

Operator Precedence:
- Usual mathematical conventions  

Function calls:
- ```3 + f(x, y, z)```
- ```printf("%d/n", 5)``` - function call - substitute 5 for %d
  - %d = display as a decimal number
  - produces the # of chars printed

##### Statements:
- ```printf("%d\n", 5);``` - **;** makes any expr. a statement (command)
- Value produced by the statement is ignored
- Expr is evaluated only for its side-effects  
```1 + 2;``` - legal, but useless
- ```return 0;``` Produce the value 0 as the result of this function (control returns immediately to the caller)
- ```;``` Empty statement (do nothing)
- Other statement forms to come

##### Blocks:
- Groups of statements, treated as one statement  
```{stmt1 stmt2 ... stmtn}```

##### Functions:
```C
int f(int x, int y) {
  printf("x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y);
  return x + y;
}
```
Think:
```Scheme
; f : Num Num -> num
(define (f x y)
  (printf "x=~a, y=~a\n", x y)
  (+ x y))
```

function call:
- f(4, 3) - expr (produces 7)
- f(4, 3); - statement

Note: Contracts (type signatures) are required and enforced

##### Program
- Sequence of Functions
- Starting point: function main
```C
int main() {
    ...
    ...
}
```

Example:
```C
int main() {
    f(4, 3);
    return 0;
}
int f(int x, int y) {...}
```
Doesn't compile. Why?  
- main doesn't know what f is.

C enforces declaration before use:
- Cant use a function/vaiable/etc until you tell C aout it

Solution 1 - Put f first
```C
int f(int x, int y) {...}
int main() {
    f(4, 3);
    return 0;
}
```
- Ok, but more than necessary
```C
int f(int x, int y) {...}
```
- is both a decleration (tells C about the function)  
and a definition (completely constructs the function)

C only requires declaration before use  
So, you can have
```C
int f(int x, int y);
```
- function prototype or header
- decl. only

```C
int f(int x, int y);

int main() {
    f(4, 3);
    return 0;
}

int f(int x, int y) {
  ...
}
```

Still doesn't compile.
  - What is printf?
  - no declaration for printf

```C
int printf(...);
int f(int x, int y);
int main() {
  ...
}
int f(int x, int y) {
  ...
}
```
Rather than declare every standard library function header before you use it, C provides "header files":
```C
#include<stdio.h>

int f(int x, int y);
int main(){
  ...
}
int f(int x, int y) {
  ...
}
```
#include - not part of the C language
- Directive to the C preprocessor (which runs before the compiler)
- Like macro expansion in Racket. (cond, if)
- ```#include <file.h>```
"drop the contents of file.h right here"

stdio.h
- contains declarations for printf and other I/O functions
- located in a "standard place"  
eg /usr/include

Now the compiler is satisified.

Still technically incomplete
- Where is the code that implements printf?
- printf was written once, compiled once, and put in a "standard place"  
eg /usr/lib
- Code for printf must be combined with this code
  - "Linking"
  - A linker takes care of this
  - Linker runs automatically
    - "Knows" to link in the code for printf

If you write your own modules, you need to tell the linker about them (later)

```C
int main() {
  ...
  return 0;
}
```
- Who does this 0 go to? The OS
- Tells if the program succeeded or failed
- echo $?

##### Variables

```C
int f(int x, int y) {
  int z = x + y
  int w = 2;
  return z/w;
}
```

##### Input
```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
  char c = getchar();
  return c;
}
```
- Characters are just small ints

Read in a number
```C
#include<stdio.h>
int getIntHelper(int acc) {
  char c = getchar();
  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') return getIntHelper(acc * 10 + c - '0');
  else return acc;
}
int getInt() {
  return getIntHelper(0);
}
```
