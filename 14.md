### ADT Dictionary
- Use a vector? O(1) retrieval time
- Size of vector = maximum key?
  - Will waste space

#### Use a combination - Create a vector of association lists
- Called a hash table

```
(define (create-hashtable size) (make-vector size empty))
```
- To which association list should we add (k, v)?
- Need to map k to a vector index
  - mapping called a hash function
  - for simplicity (albeit inefficient) - use the remainder of k by the length of the vector
  - for this idea to work well, the hash fn must distribute keys evenly over the indices

```
(define (ht-search table key)
  (define index (modulo key (vector-length table)))
  (define hashlist (vector-ref table index))
  (define lookup (assoc key hashlist))
  (if lookup (second lookup) false))

(define (ht-add table key val)
  (define index (module key (vector-length tabke)))
  (define hashlist (vector-ref table index))
  (define lookup (assoc key hashlist))
  (if lookup
      (when (not (equal? (second lookup) val))
            (vector-set! table index
              (cons (list key val)
                    (remove lookup hashlist))))
      (vector-set! table index (cons (list key val) hashlist))))
```
- If keys are not numbers - need a hash fn that maps keys to numeric values
- Not actually O(1), really more like O(n/k)

### ADTs in C
- C doesn't have modules. C has files.

#### Implement ADT sequence in C
Operations: empty sequence
- insert(s, i, e)
  - insert in e at index i in s
  - Pre: 0 <= i <= size(s)
- size(s)
  - \# of elements in s
- remove(s, i)
  - remove item from index i
  - Pre: 0 <= i <= size(s) - 1
- index(s, i) returns the ith element of s
  - Pre: 0 <= size(s) - 1

WANT: No limits on size - sequence can grow as needed

##### Implementation Options
- Linked List
  - Easy to grow
  - Slow index
- Array
  - fast index
  - hard to grow

Going with arrays, and worrying about growing later

##### Approach: partially-filled heap-array
```C
Struct Sequence {
  int* theArray;
  int size; //How many items are in use?
  int cap; //How many items can I hold?
}
```

##### How to structure:
- sequence.h

```C
struct Sequence {
  int size, cap;
  int* theArray;
}
struct Sequence emptySeq();
void add(struct Sequence* s, int i, int e);
int seqSize(struct Sequence* s, int i);
void remove(struct Sequence* s, int i);
int index(struct Sequence s, int i);
void freeSeq(struct Sequence* s);
```

- sequence.c

```C
#include "sequence.h"

```
