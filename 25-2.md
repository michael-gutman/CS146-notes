# Module 4 - MMIX

## Why PRIMP isn't realistic
- Locations are a fixed size (32 bits or 64 bits)
  - No matter what the PRIMP vector location holds (number, instr, etc), it **must** fit in 32 bits (or 64).
  - encoding scheme for numbers (representation in bits)
  - encoding scheme for instrs
  - etc
  - these **will** overlap
  - only way to tell what the word represents is by context

### Terminology
- bits are grouped into 8 bytes of 8 bits each
- 7:0 (bits 7 - 0) - least significant byte
- 63:56 - most significant byte
- each byte has an address
- the address of a word is the address of the most significant byte
- addresses increase "left to right"
  - called a big-endian architecture (other direction is little endian)
- addresses of words are always divisible by 8
  - #s represented in binary as sum of the 64 powers of 2*bit

#### Negative #s - 2s complement notation
- positive: 0-padded on the left
- negative: 1-padded on the left
  - 0 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 = 0
  - 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 = -1
  - if you have all 1s and add 1 again, it goes back to 0
    - so 1111...111 is the number such that if you add 1 you get 0
- to negate a 2s comp # - flip the bits + add 1
  - 5 = 0000...0101
  - -5 = 1111...1011
- If the first bit is 1 - is that a negative or a large positive?
  - For us: negative

## Why PRIMP isn't realistic (cont'd)
- large memories are slow
- most instrs run in 1 or 2 cycles
- memory access can take 10s or 100s of cycles
