## SIMP->MMIX compiler
- Size of #s - unbounded in SIMP, 64bits in MMIX

#### Options
- implement "bignums" in MMIX
  - arrays/lists of "big digits"
  - routines to do math on these
- (C,etc) - don't allow unbounded #s in SIMP
  - what happens when computation gives you a too-large #?
  - crash? nothing? indicate overflow?
  - chance to recover?
- many languages do nothing (performance)
  - could check whether an operation would overflow before performing it
- Some architectures - store the result of mult in 2 regs
  - the programmer can decide what to do

#### Strings
- can declare blocks of memory to hold strings/act as char buffers in MMIX
- watch alignment - anything with a label needs to start on a 4-byte boundary

#### Registers vs memory
- compiler must decide what to hold in registers vs place in memory
- may run out of regs (too many temporaries, recursion, etc)
  - "spill" to RAM as necessary
