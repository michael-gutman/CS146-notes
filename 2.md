# Reasoning about side-effects
For pure functional programming- substitution model
Can the substitution model be adapted?
- "state of the world" is an extra input and output at each
step
- Each reduction step transforms the program and also the
state of the world

How do we model "the state of the world"?
- Modelling the entire world is an impossible task
- Can't even write something down without changing that state
- Simple cases - list of definitions
- More complex cases - Memory Model (RAM)
  - 32-bit RAM (Random Access Memory)
  - Memory Addresses with 32bits of content each
  - Will use later

# Modelling Output
- Simplest kind of side-effect
- "State of the world" is the sequence of chars that have
been printed to the screen
- Each step may or may not add to the sequence

Note: every string is just a sequence of characters
(string->list)

# Substitution Model:
Each step is a version of the program by applying
one reduction step to the version before it
(Pi_0 -> ... -> Pi_n)

Now also: w_0 -> w_1 -> w_2 -> ... w_n
- each w_i is a version of the output sequence
- each w_i is a prefix of w_(i+1) (can't "unprint" chars)

Combined: (Pi_0, w_0) -> (Pi_1, w_1) -> ... -> (Pi_n, w_n)

But some program reductions create definitions,
e.g. local - Defined values will eventually change

Better to seperate out the sequence of defns, D.
(Pi_0, D_0, w_0) -> (Pi_1, D_1, w_1) -> ... ->
(Pi_n, D_n, w_n)
D_0, w_0 empty

If Pi_0 = (define id exp) ...
- Reduce exp according to the usual CS145/146 rules
  - May cause chars to be sent to w
- exp now reduced to a val
- remove (define id val) from Pi and add to D

If Pi_0 = exp ...
- Reduce exp according to the usual CS145/146 rules
  - May cause chars to be sent to w
- exp now reduced to a val - Remove from Pi
- chars that make up value added to w

When Pi is empty - done

D, w - State - That which changes,
other than the program itself.
- w - Relatively harmless, programs don't generally ask
'what's on the screen?'. Changes to w don't affect the
running of the program.
- D - Not a problem yet because variables are not yet
changing (adding new definitions not really side-effects)

# Affecting w
- (display x) - outputs the value of x, no line break
- (newline) - line break
- (printf "The answer is ~a.\n" x) -> (x = 20) The answer is
20
  - Formatted print
  - The value of x replaces ~a
  - \n = newline char (as a Racket char: #\newline)

But then, what do display, newline, and printf return?
- Special value #< void >
  - Not displayed in DrRacket
  - For fns that essentially return nothing
  - Also the result of evaluating (void)
- Fns that return void are often called statements or
commands (where imperative programming gets its name)

# Recall: map
```Scheme
(map f (list l_1 ... l_n))
```
produces
```Scheme
(list (f l_1) ... (f l_n))
```
- What if f is a statement
  - Needed for side-effects
  - Produces void
  - Then
  ```Scheme
  (map f (list l_1 ... l_n))
  ```
  produces
  ```Scheme
  (list #<void> ... #<void>)
  ```
  - Not useful

# Now Consider: for-Each
```Scheme
(for-each f (list l_1 ... l_n))
```
performs
```Scheme
(f l_1)
.
.
.
(f l_n)
```
and produces void

Example:
```Scheme
(define (print-with-spaces lst)
  (for-each (lambda (x) (printf "~a " x)) lst))
```

Writing for-each:
```Scheme
(define (for-each f lst)
  (cond [(empty? lst) (void)]
        [else (f (first lst))
              (for-each f (rest lst))]))
```
Makes use of the 'implicit begin' in the answer of cond

Using if
```Scheme
(define (for-each f lst)
  (if (empty? lst)
      (void)
      (begin (f (first lst)) (for-each f (rest lst)))))
```
Doing nothing in one case of an if condition is common enough
that there is a specialized form:
```Scheme
(define (for-each f lst)
  (unless (empty? lst)
  (f (first lst)) (for-each f (rest lst))))
```
- (unless ...) evaluates body exprs if test is false
- Similarly (when ...) evaluates body exprs if test is true

# Reasoning about output, cont.
- Before we had output,
  1. Order of operations didn't matter
  (assuming no crashes/non-termination)
  2. All non-terminating programs could be considered
  equivalent (not meaningful)
- Now,
  1. Order of evaluation may affect order of output
  2. Non-terminating programs can do interesting things,
  e.g. print the digits of Pi

Semantic model should include the possibility of
non-terminating programs, meaning:
- What the program would produce "in the limit"
- O (set of all possible values of w) would include finite
and infinite sequences of characters

# What if you want to "save" the output?
```Scheme
(with-output-to-file
  "myoutput.txt" (lambda () (printf "Test \n")))
```
- "myoutput.txt" -> name of file
- "thunk" -> fn with no args
- with-output-to-file invokes the thunk and saves the output
in the file

Better:
- don't decide what to do with the output, let
the user decide
- Linux shell - Output redirection

# Why do we need output?
- Racket has a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
  - Can just call fns and see the result
- Many languages
  - Compile-Link-Execute cycle
  - Program is translated by a compiler to native machine
  code and then executed from the command line
  - Only see output if the program prints it
  - Eg
  ```C
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main(void){
      printf("Hello world!\n")
      return 0;
    }
  ```

A use in Racket - Tracing programs
```Scheme
(define (fact n)
  (printf "fact applied to argument ~a\n" n)
  (if (zero? n) 1 (* n (fact (sub1 n)))))
```
- Can aid in debugging
