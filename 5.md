### Recall
```C
#include<stdio.h>
int getIntHelper(int acc) {
  char c = getchar();
  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')
    return getIntHelper(acc * 10 + c - '0');
  else return acc;
} 
int getInt() {
  return getIntHelper(0);
}
```
OR

```C
int getIntHelper(int acc) {
  char c = getChar();
  return (c >= '0' && c <= '9') ? getIntHelper(acc * 10 + c - '0') : acc;
}
```
Dangling else problem
```
if (test1)
  if (test2)
    stmt2
else
  stmt3
```
else goes with the nearest unmatched if
### Conditional Operator ?:
(also called the ternary operator)  
- if-else is a statement
- ?: creates an expression
- ```a ? b : c``` has value b if a is true and c if a is false

Note: No built in boolean type in C
- 0 means false
- Non-zero (often 1) means true  
eg ``` if (0) {...} ``` - false condition
- bool type, constants true, false : stdbool.h
  - 'Lets let bool mean int', 'let false = 0', 'let true = 1'

### Characters
- Restricted form of integer
- Everything in memory is just a number anyway, why pretend its not
- int - varies, but typically 32 bits (~ 4x10^9 distinct values)
- char - 8 bits (256 distinct values)
- '0' - the character 0, numerically 48
- '9' = 57 (48+0)
- ```char c = '0'``` identical to ```char c = 48```

Everything in memory is a number, so every char must have a numeric code that represents it.

##### (some useful) ASCII Code:
- '\n' = 10
- '[space]' = 32
- '0' - '9' = 48 - 57
- 'A' - 'Z' = 65 - 90
- 'a' - 'z' = 91 - 122

Convert a digit char c to its numeric value: ```c - '0'```  
Convert a # (0-9) to ASCII: ```c + '0'```

### A second look at getchar();
The prototype for getchar is actually ```int getchar()```  
Why _int_ if it's supposed to produce a char?  
What if there are no chars (EOF)?
If getchar() returned a char, there would be no way to indicate EOF. (Every possible returned value represents a valid character)  
If there are no chars (EOF), getchar produces an int that can't possibly be a char (0..255)  
The Constant EOF dontes the value getchar prodces on EOF (often, EOF = -1)

##### Next Question:
getInt burns a character after reading an int.
- does C have a f'n like Racket's peek-char?

No, but it has ungetc - stuffs a char back into the input stream

```C
int peekchar() {
  int c = getchar();
  return c == EOF ? EOF : ungetc(c, stdin);
}
```
Improved getInt - doesn't burn a char
```C
#include <ctype.h> //character predicates
int getIntHelper (int acc) {
  int c = peekchar();
  return isdigit(c) ? getIntHelper(10 * acc + getchar() - '0');
}
```
The consant struggle that every programmer faces between abstraction and efficiency.  
More efficient - doesn't call getchar twice per char:
```C
int getIntHelper(int acc) {
  int c = getchar();
  return isdigit(c) ? getIntHelper(10 * acc + 'c' - '0')
                    : (ungetc(c, stdin), acc);
}
```
```a, b``` evaluate a, then evaluate b, the result is the value of b  
like (begin a b)

What if there is whitespace before we reach the int?

```C
void skipws() {
  int c = getchar();
  if (isspace(c)) {
    skipws();
  }
  else ungetc(c, stdin);
}
```
(doesn't take into account EOF)

A void function
- returns nothing
- Cannot be used in an expression  
eg ```void x = skipws(); //ILLEGAL```
- There are no void variables
- Only good for side effects

Returning from void functions:
- Reach the end, or,
- return; (no expr)

So get int becomes
```C
int getInt() {
  skipws();
  return getIntHelper(0);
}
```

### Mutation
Basic mutation: ```set!```
```
(define x 3)
(set! x 4)
x
; -> 4
```
- Produces (void)
- Changes D
- x must have been previously defined

Example:
```
(lookup 'Brad)
; -> false
(add 'Brad 36484)
(lookup 'Brad)
; -> 36484
```
- Not possible in pure Racket
- Same expression can't produce different results

In Impure racket:
```
(define address-book empty)
```
- Global variable
- Visible throughout the program

```
(define (add name number)
  (set! address-book (cons (list name number) address-book)))
```
