#### Recall:
```C
Struct Posn makePosn(int x, int y) {
  struct Posn p;
  p.x = malloc(sizeof(int))
  p.y = malloc(sizeof(int))
  *p.x = x;
  *p.y = y;
  return p;
}
```

### Memory Layout (applies to C and Racket)
### RAM:
- Your program's binary code
- Your Program's Data
  - Static Area
  - Heap
  - Stack

#### Static Area
- where global/static vars are stored
- lifetime: entire program

(skipping over the heap for now)

#### Stack
##### What is a stack?
- An ADT with LIFO semantics
  - LIFO = Last in, first out
  - Can only Remove the most recently inserted item
- Operations:
  - Push - Add an item to the Stack
  - Top - What is the most recently inserted item?
  - Pop - Remove the most recently inserted item
  - Empty? - Is the stack empty?

##### Racket lists are stacks
- Push = cons
- Top = first/car
- Pop = rest/cdr

##### Program Stack
- Stores local variables

```C
int fact(int n) {
  int rec =  0;
  if (n == 0) return 1;
  rec = fact(n-1);
  return n*rec;
}

int main() {
  int f = fact(3);
}
```
- Each call to fact gets added on top of the stack
- The last function call is the first to return
- The stack then shrinks as functions return


- Each function *call* gets a *stack frame*
- also return address - where to go when the function returns
- each call to a function gets its own version of the local variables
- When a function returns - it's stack frame is popped
   - all local vars in that frame are released
    - The variables are **not** typically erased
    - "top of stack pointer" is moved to top of next frame
    - will be overwritten the next time a frame is pushed onto the stack
- Lifetime of a stack data - duration of the function call/block/scope

##### So what if you have data that must persist after a fn returns?

e.g, What's wrong with:
```C
struct Posn makePosn(int x, int y) {
  struct Posn p;
  int a = x, b = y;
  p.x = &a;
  p.y = &b;
  return p;
}
```
- a, b on the stack, so as soon as p returns, p is pointing into the wilderness

##### So: malloc requests memory from the heap
- Pool of memory from which you can explicitly request "chunks"
- Lifetime is arbitrary

- When make posn returns
- p (incl p.x, p.y) popped off the stack
- 3 and 4 on the heap
- p from makePosn copied back to main's frame
- main has access to 3 and 4 on the heap
  - these outlive makePosn

##### What is the lifetime of heap-allocated data?
- arbitrarily long
- If heap allocated data never goes away,
program will eventually run out of memory
  - even if most of the data in memory is no longer in use

##### Racket soln
- a run-time process detects memory that is no longer accessible
(has nothing pointing at it)

```
(define (f x)
  (define p (posn 3 4))
  ...
  (+ x 1))
```
- Posn p not needed after fn returns
- Automatically reclaims memory - "garbage collection"

##### C soln: Heap memory is freed when you free it
```C
int *p = malloc(...);
...
free(p); //release p's memory back to the heap
```
- Failing to free all allocated memory - "Memory leak"
- Programs that leak will eventually fail (if they run long enough)

Now:
```C
int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
free(p);
*p = 7; //Will this crash?
```
- probably doesn't crash
- free(p) doesn't change p
- p still points to that memory
  - storing something there probably still works
- But p is not pointing at a valid location
  - that location may be assigned to another ptr by another malloc call
- Called a "dangling pointer" (BAD)

Better: after free(p), assign p to point to a guaranteed-invalid location:
```C
int *p = malloc(...)
free(p);
p = NULL;
```
##### NULL
- Not really part of the C language
- defined constant equal to 0
- could equally well say ```p = 0;```

Derefrencing NULL
- undefined behaviour
- program *may* crash

```C
int main() {
  int *p = NULL;
  *p;
}
```

Consider again
```C
int *f() {
  int x = 4;
  return &x;
}

int g() {
  int y = 5;
  return y;
}

int main() {
  int *p = f();
  g();
  printf("%d\n", *p);
}
```
- p pts to dead Memory
- when f returns, x no longer a valid location
- a *dangling pointer*
- Program may not crash
- May behave badly
- g occupies f's old stack frame
- y now occupies x's old slot
- \*p is now 5 (still a dangling ptr)

#### Lesson: Never return a ptr to a local variable
- If you want to return a ptr - it should point to static, heap, or non-local stack data
